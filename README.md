# dalybms2pylontechhv

This project aims to create a multi Daly BMS to single Pylontech HV (high voltage) protocol bridge over RS-485 and CAN bus.

## Units

The following units are the standard units for the code unless otherwise specified:

- Voltage: mV (int32_t)
- Current: mA (int32_t)
- Temperature: dÂºC (deca-degrees Celsius, x10^-1) (int16_t)
- Capacity: mAh (int32_t)
